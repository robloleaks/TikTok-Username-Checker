# TikTok-Username-Checker
Returns availability of TikTok username lists.

## Information
This tool was strictly developed to demonstrate how straightforward it is to claim OG usernames on platforms like TikTok — simply paste the usernames you would like to check the availabilities for in Usernames.txt and run main.py. However, it is spamming TikTok's API, so please refrain from using this TikTok Username Checker. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk. You have been warned.

## Usage
- Python 3.8 or above is required.
- I develop for Windows machines only and do not intentionally support other operating systems.
- If you do not already have the **Requests** library installed, run setup.py — make sure PIP is added to PATH.
1. Paste the usernames in .\Usernames.txt.
2. Run main.py.

## Legal Notice
This is illegal if you use it without the consent of the creators — in this case, the TikTok team. I am not accountable for any of your actions; this was merely a speedrun to demonstrate how username checkers work. Please do not misuse this tool.
